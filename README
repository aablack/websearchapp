Instructions
=================================
The following instructions have been tested under Linux. The project doesn't use any
3rd party libraries so it should be possible to run the project under Windows.

Configuration.
You need to obtain a trial for the Bing Search API. See https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/.
Once complete click on "My Account" -> "ACCOUNT INFORMATION" and copy the "Primary Account
Key".
In the websearchapp directory open websearchapp/settings.py and paste the Account Key
into the BING_ACCOUNT_KEY variable.

Now you should be able to start the server. Run the following command from the root
websearchapp directory.

python manage.py runserver

Open a web browser on the same system and go to the address:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/search

Assuming Django started successfully you should see a search page and be able
to perform a search.
